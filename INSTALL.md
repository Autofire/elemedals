Elemedals Install
=================

If you're on Windows, you're on your own. Chances are, you cannot compile Anura. Just wait until an installer is available. (Which will be soon!)

If you run on Linux, you'll have to compile the Anura engine. (https://github.com/anura-engine/anura) Note that this will ''probably'' get fixed soon. Frogatto's binaries should be coming around the corner soon.

If you run Mac, I assume you can also compile the Anura engine. Haven't tested it.
