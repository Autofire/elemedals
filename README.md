Elemedals is a fangame for Spiral Knights. It's still a early WIP, and it's writen with Anura,
the engine used to create Frogatto. As of now, you will have to have the Frogatto module.

You will need Frogatto to use this module! The demo is fine. (Get the demo at
"www.desura.com/games/frogatto". You will have to compile Anura yourself if you're a Linux user.)

At this time, anyone wanting to try the this module will have to have some ability to navigate
folders and stuff. This will be remidied in future versions.
