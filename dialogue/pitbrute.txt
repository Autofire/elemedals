Pivot: What's that thing?
Joint: A Pit Brute. 
Pit Brute: GO AWAY! I'm trying to work!
P: Uh, what's in those crates?
B: It's a secret! Boss will kill me if I say!
J: *That's* a let down.
P: Yeah, can't you just give us a hint?
J: No, I mean, he's a bit shorter than I expected.
B: Did you just call me short!?
J: As a matter of fact, I would say that he's a runt.
B: *WHAT!?* <Screen shakes>
P: Joint, shut up!
J: Yep, he's a short one.
B: I'LL CRUSH YOU FOR THAT!
J: You know what to do, shorty! Er, Pivot!
P: *sighs*
