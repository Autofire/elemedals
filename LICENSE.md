As of now, the license is incomplete. All you need to know is that many
assets of this game are based off of Spiral Knights, which is a game created
by Three Rings. Because of that, I recommend you go ask them if you have any
questions.

Also, because of this, you cannot sell anything you see here. This is purely
a fangame, and because of that, this is a non-profit project.
