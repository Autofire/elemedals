# Level triggers are carriers for custom code - code which will be triggered when a lever or pressure-plate is switched.  Normally the majority of their target objects are fixed-function devices like fans/platforms/gates; the purpose of this object is to be a catch-all for any weird custom things (like doing an off-level cutscene).
