[~<em>NOTE: This doesn't work on Windows yet!</em>
Elemedals uses the module servers
that the Frogatto team has set up.
Whenever the game is started, Elemedals
will check these servers for a new version.
If it finds a newer version, and you have
<em>not</em> downloaded the game via Github,
Elemedals will automatically update itself.
If you don't want the game doing this,
you may turn it off.
Locate the <em>master-config.cfg</em> file in the
same folder than <em>anura.exe</em> is located in.
Open <em>master-config.cfg</em> in some text editor,
and change the line that ends in
...<em>"module=elemedals"]</em> to
<em>arguments: ["--module=elemedals"]</em>
NOTE: Other than Github, the auto-updating
will be the only way to get recent versions
of the game. If you'd rather be able to
handle updates yourself, I suggest you install
the game using Github.~]
