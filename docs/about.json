[~Elemedals is a fan game based upon a game called
Spiral Knights, which is currently being run by Grey Havens.~],
[~Our goal in making this is to preserve a piece of
Spiral Knights for future players to experience.~],
[~Of course, this game isn't exactly like the original
game, because the original is a top-down MMO.~],
[~As of now, the game is being developed
by a very small team of one.~],
