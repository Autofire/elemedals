[~Elemedals is a fan game based upon a game called
Spiral Knights,
which is currently being run by Grey Havens.
Our goal in making this is to preserve a piece of
Spiral Knights for future players to experience.
Of course, this game isn't exactly like the original
game, because the original is a top-down MMO.
As of now, the game is being developed
by a very small team of one.
I make no promises as to quality, or even that
this game will ever be completed.
Really, this is just a project of mine.
But I've had a blast making it. 
I hope you have fun with this version.~]
