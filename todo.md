Bold is for done. Should be done in the following order:

**Make Gun Puppy be able to multi-shot.**
Fix the Chromalisk's AI.
Get player charging working. (DO NOT CREATE PLAYER'S SPIN YET.)
Make player's gun work. (NO ANIMATIONS)
Make player's charged gun shots work.
Make player's bomb work.
Create level.

Create player's Calibur charged attack.
Get the Gun Puppy's explosion thingy working... maybe.
