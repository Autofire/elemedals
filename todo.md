**Make Gun Puppy be able to multi-shot.**
Mon: Make player's gun work. (NO ANIMATIONS)
Tue: Get player charging working. (DO NOT CREATE PLAYER'S SPIN YET.)
Tue: Make player's charged gun shots work.
Wed: Make player's bomb work.
Thur: Fix the Chromalisk's AI.
Fri: Create level.

Create player's Calibur charged attack.
Get the Gun Puppy's explosion thingy working... maybe.
