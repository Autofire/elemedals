As of now, the license is incomplete. All you need to know is that many assets of this game are based off of Spiral Knights, which is a game created by Three Rings. Because of that, we recommend you go ask them if you have any questions. Spiral Knights' website can be found at http://www.spiralknights.com/, and the customer support can be accessed via https://www.spiralknights.com/support/#mail.

Because of the nature of this project, you cannot sell anything you see here. This is purely a fangame, and because of that, this is a non-profit project.

This file will be shown to Three Rings, and shall be revised based on their feedback.
