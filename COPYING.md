This game is inspired by Spiral Knights. That means many of the characters, items, environments, and story may be based off or come from Spiral Knights.

In addition, the current version requires the Frogatto module. The demo works fine, so distribute that with this game. Do **not** give away the full version of Frogatto, since you must buy that game.

Being a fan game, this is a non-profit project.

To sum that up, **you can freely distribute this module as long as you do not make any money for it and do not include the full version of Frogatto.**
